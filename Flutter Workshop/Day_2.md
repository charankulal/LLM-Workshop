### **Overview of the App**
The app is a simple task management application called **Tasky**, where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. It integrates with Firebase Firestore to store the tasks in a cloud database and provide real-time updates to the app. 

The app is built with **Flutter**, and here are the main steps involved in creating and understanding this app:

---

### **Step 1: Setting Up Firebase**
Before diving into the Flutter code, Firebase needs to be set up:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and add your app to Firebase (Android/iOS).
   - Download the `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and add them to the respective platforms in your Flutter project.

2. **Add Firebase Dependencies:**
   - You need to add necessary Firebase libraries to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       firebase_core: ^latest_version
       cloud_firestore: ^latest_version
       fluttertoast: ^latest_version
     ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in Your App:**
   - In `main.dart`, you initialize Firebase before the app starts running:
     ```dart
     await Firebase.initializeApp();
     ```

---

### **Step 2: The `main.dart` File**
This file is where the app starts, and it contains the root widget of the app.

- **Firebase Initialization:**
   - The `main()` function first calls `Firebase.initializeApp()` to initialize Firebase services.
   - The app is then run using `runApp(MyApp())`.

- **MyApp Class:**
   - The root widget (`MyApp`) is a `StatelessWidget`. It returns the main layout and theme for the app using `MaterialApp`.
   - It sets up the app's theme using `ColorScheme.fromSeed`, which applies a primary color to the app.

- **Home Screen (Home Page):**
   - The home page is set as the default (`home: Home()`), which is the task list screen where users can view, add, edit, or delete tasks.

---

### **Step 3: Home Screen (`home.dart`)**
This screen is the main dashboard of the app where all tasks are displayed.

- **StatefulWidget:**
   - `Home` is a `StatefulWidget` because the task list may change (e.g., tasks are added, deleted, or updated), and we need to update the UI accordingly.
   - The state class `_HomeState` manages task data and user inputs.

- **Fetching Tasks:**
   - The `getontheload()` method uses a method from the `DatabaseMethods` class (`getAllTasks()`) to fetch all tasks from Firestore as a stream.
   - `TaskStream` is updated with the real-time stream of tasks.

- **Displaying Tasks with StreamBuilder:**
   - The `StreamBuilder` listens to the Firestore stream and rebuilds the UI whenever new data arrives.
   - Each task is displayed as a list item in a `ListView.builder()`.
   - Each task has a title, details, and buttons for editing or deleting the task.

- **Add, Edit, and Delete:**
   - **Adding a Task:** The `FloatingActionButton` on the `Home` screen navigates to the `Tasks` screen where a new task can be created.
   - **Editing a Task:** Each task item has an "edit" button (`Icons.edit`). When clicked, it opens a dialog where the user can modify the taskâ€™s title and details.
   - **Deleting a Task:** Each task also has a "delete" button (`Icons.delete`). When clicked, it removes the task from Firestore and shows a toast message to confirm the deletion.

---

### **Step 4: Task Creation (`tasks.dart`)**
This screen allows the user to create a new task by entering a title and details.

- **UI Elements:**
   - There are two text fields:
     - One for the **title** of the task.
     - Another for the **details** of the task.
   - When the user taps the "Add" button, a new task is created.

- **Generate Unique ID for Task:**
   - A unique task ID is generated using the `randomAlphaNumeric(10)` method to ensure each task has a unique identifier.

- **Add Task to Firestore:**
   - When the user presses the **Add** button, the task data (title, details, and ID) is passed to the `addTask()` method of `DatabaseMethods`.
   - This method stores the task in the Firestore database under the "task" collection.

- **Toast Confirmation:**
   - After the task is added successfully, a confirmation message (`Fluttertoast.showToast()`) appears to notify the user.

---

### **Step 5: Database Interaction (`database.dart`)**
This class handles all interactions with Firebase Firestore for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Add Task:**
   - `addTask(Map<String, dynamic> taskInfo, String id)`: Adds a new task document to the `task` collection in Firestore.
   - The task data (`taskInfo`) and unique ID are passed to the Firestore `set()` method.

- **Get All Tasks:**
   - `getAllTasks()` returns a stream of all tasks in the `task` collection using `FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection("task").snapshots()`. This allows real-time updates to the task list.

- **Update Task:**
   - `updateTask(String id, Map<String, dynamic> updateInfo)`: Updates an existing task document by its ID with the new data (`updateInfo`).
   - This method is used when a user edits a task.

- **Delete Task:**
   - `deleteTask(String id)`: Deletes a task document from Firestore using its unique ID.

---

### **Step 6: User Interactions and Flow**

1. **Viewing Tasks:**
   - The app displays all tasks in real time. Whenever a task is added, updated, or deleted, the task list automatically updates without needing to refresh the screen.

2. **Adding a Task:**
   - When the user clicks the **FloatingActionButton** on the Home screen, they are navigated to the `Tasks` screen to add a new task.
   - They input the task title and details and then click the "Add" button. The task is added to Firestore and appears on the Home screen.

3. **Editing a Task:**
   - Each task item has an "edit" button. When clicked, it shows an AlertDialog where the user can update the task's title and details.
   - After updating, the task is saved back to Firestore and the UI is refreshed.

4. **Deleting a Task:**
   - Each task also has a delete button. When clicked, the task is removed from Firestore and the UI is updated.
